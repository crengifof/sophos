-- This query will show you all other products besides Sophos AV, Windows Firewall, and Defender (only if disabled) - if Defender is 'On', it will still show up (even though this technically shouldn't happen)--

SELECT
    type,
    name,
    state,
    state_timestamp,
    remediation_path,
    signatures_up_to_date
FROM windows_security_products
WHERE name NOT LIKE '%Sophos%' AND name <> "Windows Firewall" AND (name NOT LIKE '%Defender%' AND state = 'Off')


-----------------------

-- Another way to go would be to ensure Sophos AV is in an 'On' state and only exclude products that are in an 'Off' state --


SELECT
    type,
    name,
    state,
    state_timestamp,
    remediation_path,
    signatures_up_to_date
FROM windows_security_products
WHERE name <> "Windows Firewall" AND state = 'On'
